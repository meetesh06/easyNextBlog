# A simple blog manager + site for users

This is a design template that is meant to be used in conjunction with a few scripts (I need to work to make the documentation clearer) that take information and generate pages. I used Next.JS to generate a static HTML website that can be hosted anywhere.

Take a look at the demo at: [my homepage](https://meetesh06.github.io)

It provides the following functionality

- Customizable grid layout.
- Generates simple Static HTML files, easy to host on Github.
- Smart blog navigation (all generated for offline use): The posts are simple markdown files that make it easy to write and maintain.
- Light/Dark mode support, the page uses localstorage to remember the user preference.
- That's it, simple, elegant sites for regular use :)

## How does it work?

*TODO: This section is currently incomplete*

This template is meant to be used with a bunch of different accomplying scripts, I still need to document them and release them. 


## TODO
- Bring back encrypted secret posts
